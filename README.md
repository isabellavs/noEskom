# Thanks Eskom. How many candles do I need?

## About this project:

This page requests information from a flask server about the current loadshedding stage.
Flask will obtain the relevant information from Eskom's API and return it to this frontend.

Click the buttons and see what happens.

## Backend server:

A flask server serving this site was developed to run on the same network, in this specific case, the sever ran on Windows WSL and the web page on Windows 10.
You can find the code for the server in the 'flaskEskom' repo.
